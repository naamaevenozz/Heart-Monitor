You’re the last line of defense between life and... a flatline.
Glitches are creeping through the heart monitor -  tiny black dots breaking the rhythm.
Tap them fast before the signal collapses. Miss one, and it’s all over.

Stay sharp. Stay in rhythm. Keep the pulse alive.

A short, tense, shader-based rhythm game about precision, timing, and heartbeats.
